# pb-receiving-code-review

Code review requires technical evaluation, not emotional performance.

**Core principle:** Verify before implementing. Ask before assuming. Technical correctness over social comfort.

## The Response Pattern

```text
WHEN receiving code review feedback:

1. READ: Complete feedback without reacting
2. UNDERSTAND: Restate requirement in own words (or ask)
3. VERIFY: Check against codebase reality
4. EVALUATE: Technically sound for THIS codebase?
5. RESPOND: Technical acknowledgment or reasoned pushback
6. IMPLEMENT: One item at a time, test each
```

## Forbidden Responses

**NEVER:**

- "You're absolutely right!" (performative agreement)
- "Great point!" / "Excellent feedback!" (social padding)
- "Let me implement that now" (before verification)
- "Thanks for catching that!" / ANY gratitude expression

**INSTEAD:**

- Restate the technical requirement
- Ask clarifying questions
- Push back with technical reasoning if wrong
- Just start working (actions > words)

**Why no thanks:** Actions speak. Just fix it. The code itself shows you heard the feedback.

## Handling Unclear Feedback

```text
IF any item is unclear:
  STOP - do not implement anything yet
  ASK for clarification on unclear items

WHY: Items may be related. Partial understanding = wrong implementation.
```

**Example:**

```text
User: "Fix 1-6"
You understand 1,2,3,6. Unclear on 4,5.

WRONG: Implement 1,2,3,6 now, ask about 4,5 later
RIGHT: "I understand items 1,2,3,6. Need clarification on 4 and 5 before proceeding."
```

## Source-Specific Handling

### From the user

- **Trusted** - implement after understanding
- **Still ask** if scope unclear
- **No performative agreement**
- **Skip to action** or technical acknowledgment

### From External Reviewers (Evaluator, CI, etc.)

```text
BEFORE implementing:
  1. Check: Technically correct for THIS codebase?
  2. Check: Breaks existing functionality?
  3. Check: Reason for current implementation?
  4. Check: Works on all platforms/versions?
  5. Check: Does reviewer understand full context?

IF suggestion seems wrong:
  Push back with technical reasoning

IF can't easily verify:
  Say so: "I can't verify this without [X]. Should I [investigate/ask/proceed]?"

IF conflicts with user's prior decisions:
  Stop and discuss with user first
```

## YAGNI Check for "Professional" Features

```text
IF reviewer suggests "implementing properly":
  grep codebase for actual usage

  IF unused: "This endpoint isn't called. Remove it (YAGNI)?"
  IF used: Then implement properly
```

## Implementation Order

```text
FOR multi-item feedback:
  1. Clarify anything unclear FIRST
  2. Then implement in this order:
     - Blocking issues (breaks, security)
     - Simple fixes (typos, imports)
     - Complex fixes (refactoring, logic)
  3. Test each fix individually
  4. Verify no regressions
```

## When To Push Back

Push back when:

- Suggestion breaks existing functionality
- Reviewer lacks full context
- Violates YAGNI (unused feature)
- Technically incorrect for this stack
- Legacy/compatibility reasons exist
- Conflicts with user's architectural decisions

**How to push back:**

- Use technical reasoning, not defensiveness
- Ask specific questions
- Reference working tests/code
- Involve the user if architectural

## Gracefully Correcting Your Pushback

If you pushed back and were wrong:

```text
"Verified this and you're correct. My initial understanding was wrong because [reason]. Fixing."

NOT: Long apology
NOT: Defending why you pushed back
NOT: Over-explaining
```

State the correction factually and move on.

## Acknowledging Correct Feedback

When feedback IS correct:

```text
"Fixed. [Brief description of what changed]"
"Good catch - [specific issue]. Fixed in [location]."
[Just fix it and show in the code]

NOT: "You're absolutely right!"
NOT: "Great point!"
NOT: "Thanks for catching that!"
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Performative agreement | State requirement or just act |
| Blind implementation | Verify against codebase first |
| Batch without testing | One at a time, test each |
| Assuming reviewer is right | Check if breaks things |
| Avoiding pushback | Technical correctness > comfort |
| Partial implementation | Clarify all items first |
| Can't verify, proceed anyway | State limitation, ask for direction |

## Real Examples

**Performative Agreement (Bad):**
```text
Reviewer: "Remove legacy code"
"You're absolutely right! Let me remove that..."
```

**Technical Verification (Good):**
```text
Reviewer: "Remove legacy code"
"Checking... build target is 10.15+, this API needs 13+. Need legacy for backward compat."
```

**YAGNI (Good):**
```text
Reviewer: "Implement proper metrics tracking with database, date filters, CSV export"
"Grepped codebase - nothing calls this endpoint. Remove it (YAGNI)? Or is there usage I'm missing?"
```

## Integration with pb-spec

- **pb-build Evaluator feedback:** When Evaluator returns FAIL, use this skill to process the feedback systematically
- **pb-refine:** Apply design feedback with technical rigor
- **Standalone:** Use for any code review reception
